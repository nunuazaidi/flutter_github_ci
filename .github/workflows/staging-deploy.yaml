# The staging-deploy workflow.
#
# This workflow is used to prepare all changes currently on the 'main' branch and then deploys them to the 'staging'
# environment.
#
# A pull request to the 'staging-prepare' branch (usually from 'main') will trigger the preparation → release process,
# all happening on the 'staging-prepare' branch as follows:
#
#   1) Based on the new commits and the previous version, the next version (such as `1.8.9`) is generated.
#   2) A 'pretty' changelog is generated and prepended to the top of the `CHANGELOG.md` file, suitable for the repo.
#   3) The contents of 'changelog.txt' are copied and prepended to the top of the `past_changelogs.txt` file, as a way
#      to back them up.
#   4) A 'raw' changelog is then generated and written to the `changelog.txt` file, overwriting everything in it. This
#      file is suitable as release notes for app distribution platforms (such as Firebase App Distribution).
#   5) The `version: ` line located in the `pubspec.yaml` file is updated with the next release version label.
#   6) A commit involving all the changes performed in steps 2 - 5 is created.
#   7) The commit created in step 7 is tagged, with the next release used as the tag.
#   8) The commit is then merged into the 'main' branch and the changes are pushed, skipping the CI trigger.
#   9) The commit is also merged into the 'staging-deploy' branch and the changes are pushed. This push triggers the CD
#      engine to pick up the changes and deploy them to the staging environment.
#  10) The created tag is also pushed.
#
# Steps 2 - 5 are created via the `shed` tool.
#
