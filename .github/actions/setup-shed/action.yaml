# Composite action to setup the `shed` tool.
#
# The action checks to see if the source code is already cached under `./build/shed/src` and checks that out instead,
# if not, the source code is downloaded from the `nunuazaidi/shed` repository (along with a passed in `shed-deploy-key`
# argument) and cached.
#
# The action then checks to see if the `shed` binary is already cached under `./build/shed/out` restores that instead,
# if not, the binary is generated in `./build/shed/out` and cached.
#
# For both the source `./build/shed/src` and binary output `./build/shed/out` caches, the latest commit hash for the
# `shed` repository is used as the key for each of the caches.
#
# The action takes the compiled binary and adds it to the `$GITHUB_PATH` environment variable so that it can be made
# available to any subsequent steps.
