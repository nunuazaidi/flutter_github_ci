# Post-review workflow.
#
# This workflow is used to ensure that the newly accepted changes into the 'main' branch are stable and do not break
# the code already present on the 'main' branch.
#
# The workflow is only triggered on the original repository (and not on the fork repositories) after a pull request from
# another branch (such as 'main' from a fork repository) is accepted and the pull request closed.
#
# The workflow runs the `shed test --abort-on-fail` command, which in turn runs the `flutter test` command and will
# abort the test process as soon as one test fails. The failure will also cause a reversal of the pull request.
#
# For more info, see the `nunuazaidi/shed` repository.
