# Pre-review workflow.
#
# This workflow is used to ensure the changes made are stable before they're submitted for review to the original
# repository.
#
# The workflow is triggered only on a fork repository, whenever a push is made to the 'main' branch.
# A merge request from another branch (such as a 'feature' branch) to 'main' will also trigger this workflow.
#
# The workflow runs the `shed test --abort-on-fail` command, which in turn runs the `flutter test` command and will
# abort the test process as soon as one test fails.
#
# For more info, see the `nunuazaidi/shed` repository.
